title: PRG File Format Specification

import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

- **MIME Type:** `application/vnd.graphif.project-graph+zip`
- **File Extension:** `.prg`

## 1. Introduction

The PRG file format is a container-based format for storing diagrams created in the [**Project Graph**](/docs/app) application. It leverages the ubiquitous ZIP archive format to bundle a primary serialized graph description (`stage.msgpack`) with its associated binary attachments (images, documents, etc.).

The design goals of this format are:

- **Portability:** To serve as a single, shareable file containing all project assets.
- **Interoperability:** To be based on well-established standards (ZIP, MessagePack) for ease of implementation.
- **Extensibility:** To allow for future evolution of the format while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 2. Overall Container Structure

A PRG file **MUST** be a valid ZIP archive. The structure within the ZIP filesystem is as follows:

<Files>
  <File name="stage.msgpack" />
  <Folder name="attachments" defaultOpen>
    <File name="<uuid>.<ext>" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

- All paths within the ZIP archive **MUST** use the forward slash (`/`) as the directory separator.
- All filenames **MUST** be encoded using UTF-8.

## 3. The Stage File (`stage.msgpack`)

### 3.1. Format & Encoding

The `stage.msgpack` file **MUST** exist at the root of the ZIP container. Its content **MUST** be a binary stream that is a valid MessagePack serialization of a [**Graphif Serializer**](/docs/spec/serializer) serialized array.

### 3.2. Content Schema

The deserialized content of `stage.msgpack` **MUST** be an `array`. Each element in this array **MUST** be an `object` representing a **Stage Object**.

#### 3.2.1. Stage Object

A Stage Object (an `object`) **MUST** contain the following entry:

- **`uuid`** (Key): A `string` value representing the unique identifier for this stage.

The Stage Object **MAY** contain any number of other entries to define the graph's nodes, edges, properties, and references to attachments. The specific schema for these entries is defined by the Graphif Serializer specification.

_Any implementation that encounters a Stage Object with an unknown structure SHOULD ignore the unrecognized entries and continue processing._

## 4. The Attachments Directory (`attachments/`)

### 4.1. Purpose

The `attachments/` directory is an optional container for any binary or text files referenced by the stage(s), such as images, documents, or other media.

### 4.2. Naming Convention

Files within the `attachments/` directory **MUST** be named using a **Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)** followed by a file extension that implies the file's MIME type.

**Example:**

- `attachments/b54c5f6c-6f28-4d65-bcc5-4c891c6dbd77.png`
- `attachments/f8a3d2b1-4e5c-6789-0123-456789abcdef.pdf`

### 4.3. Referencing Attachments

Stage Objects reference these files by their **UUID filename (without the extension)**. For example, an `ImageNode` object would reference the attachment `b54c5f6c-6f28-4d65-bcc5-4c891c6dbd77.png` using the string `"b54c5f6c-6f28-4d65-bcc5-4c891c6dbd77"`.

## 5. Security Considerations

Implementors and users of this format should be aware of several security-related aspects:

1.  **ZIP Container Risks:**
    - **Compression Bombs:** A PRG file may contain a small ZIP that decompresses to an extremely large amount of data, causing denial-of-service. Implementations **MUST** impose reasonable limits on the number of extracted files and the total uncompressed size.
    - **Path Traversal:** Maliciously crafted ZIP entries could have names like `../../../some_important_file`. Implementations **MUST NOT** extract files to filesystem, instead, read them directly from the ZIP stream to memory or a controlled environment.

2.  **Attachment Risks:** The attachments directory can contain any file type. The application processing the PRG file is responsible for handling each attachment in a secure manner (e.g., run script files in sandbox, detect malware in attachments).

## 6. Future Considerations

This section outlines potential extensions to the format for future discussion and development.

### 6.1. Metadata (`metadata.msgpack`)

A future version may introduce a dedicated file at the root of the container (e.g., `metadata.msgpack`) to store information about the project itself, decoupling it from the stage data.

### 6.2. Versioning (`versions/` directory)

A `versions/` directory could be introduced to store historical snapshots of the `stage.msgpack` file, enabling built-in version control and audit trails. Each snapshot could be a copy of `stage.msgpack` named by a timestamp or commit hash.

### 6.3. Sub-Stages (`sub/` directory)

To avoid the inefficiency of nested ZIP files (storing a `.prg` inside another `.prg`), a `sub/` directory could store additional Stage files. This would allow for complex, multi-stage projects within a single container.

**Structure:** `sub/<uuid>.msgpack`

### 6.4. Workspace Settings (`settings.msgpack`)

Application-specific settings (e.g., default node styles, view preferences) could be stored in a root-level file like `settings.json`, making the PRG file a self-contained workspace.
